				<p>Dedicated to true trekkers, The Red Ape Trail is a challenging but rewarding 3 full day trek that passes through orangutan habitat deep in the heart of the Sarawak rainforest. You will cover between 5-6km per day on these full trekking days. You will see very few others throughout your time here. Spend your days in the forest trying to spot orangutans, and when over nighting in a longhouse, take in the fascinating local Iban culture. Fully immerse yourself in the wonders of the rainforest when over nighting in the basic jungle camps.</p>
