						On June 5, 2015 a 6.0 magnitude earth quake hits Sabah claiming 18 lives comprising of climbers and mountain guides. The epicentre of the quake was 54 km from the world UNESCO site of Mount Kinabalu, standing at 4,095 meters. Strong tremors were felt in Kota Kinabalu city and most of the northwestern area of the state when the earth quake struck at 7.15AM local time. More than a hundred climbers were stranded on the summit following the strong tremors, triggering landslides and streams of falling rocks and boulders rendering the summit route impenetrable.<br /><br />
						Clearance and reconstruction for the new summit route has begun, and the mountain is expected to be re-open to the public by September. Numbers of climbers will be limited for the early stages of its re-opening taking 90 climbers a day rather than the 192 climbers permitted daily.<br /><br />
						Due to this, all bookings for Mt Kinabalu Climb and Via Ferrata has been cancelled until further notice, bookings for September are not open yet. Thank you for your patience and understanding.<br /><br />
						Our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those lost in the wake of this tragedy.<br /><br />
						For climbers who have paid and confirmed their climbing dates, and now unable to climb, we will be providing alternative destination options or refunds. Our consultants will be in touch with you shortly if they have not already.
