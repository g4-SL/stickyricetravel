				<p>If you are a wildlife and nature geek, you will find paradise in Danum Valley - a 472km sq conservation area of pristine, mostly primary, lowland dipterocarp forest that is home to 300 species of birds, mammals, insects etc. Sabah yesteryears' rampant jungle clearing left only a handful of forest untouched and Danum Valley Conservation Area is one of them. The area boasts an amazing diversity of animal life including the highly endangered Sumatran rhino, Borneo pygmy elephant, sun bear, orang utan and clouded leopard. Eight species of hornbills can be found here.</p>
				<p>Lose yourself in the immense beauty of untouched nature as you watch the sun rises atop huge tree canopies. Your days will be spent walking and trekking in the forest in hope of seeing a mother orang utan with her baby, Wallace's flying frog, Borneon Gibbon, Rhinoceros Hornbill or the elusive Clouded Leopard. Trek to many waterfalls and visit Orang Sungai burial sites where ancient wooden carvings and coffin can be seen. Learn of forest regeneration and understand the complexity of the 130 million year old rainforest in one of the last places of its kind.</p>
				<p>The Danum Valley Conservation Area is about 2 and a half hours drive from the town of Lahad Datu that is accessible via public bus and plane. Yayasan Sabah manages the Danum Valley Conservation Area and there are only TWO accommodation options for nature visitors of the area. We recommend that you read in detail these options prior to booking with us. If you still have further questions regarding your visit to Danum Valley, please contact us.</p>
				<p>With 5 star rating, Borneo Rainforest Lodge is tucked within the conservation area and is built to cater to tourist or wildlife and nature enthusiasts. Tastefully designed and built into its surrounding environment, BRL provides excellent service, food and accommodation. </p>
