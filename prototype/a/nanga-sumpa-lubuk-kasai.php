				This program combines the Nanga Sumpa Longhouse &amp; Lubok Kasai Jungle Camp experience; the Lubok Kasai Camp is located a 30-45 minute boat ride upriver from Nanga Sumpa, deep in the heart of Borneo. It is situated on the banks of the Lalang River in an area where orangutan are sighted. The camp is located in a stunning setting at the edge of the rainforest. Lubok Kasai is for people who want to experience a totally natural and tranquil setting; away from the sights, sounds and activities of a vibrant longhouse. Staying at Lubok Kasai offers the chance to explore the rainforest, spot wildlife and enjoy the cool waters of the Lalang River.
