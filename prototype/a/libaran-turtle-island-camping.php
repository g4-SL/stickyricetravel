				<b>Walai Penyu Libaran Resort</b><br />
				It's not camping, its glamping! Take on the outdoors in style and comfort, as Walai Penyu Libaran Resort offers a camp trip unlike any other.
				</p>
				<p>
				An establishment aimed at turtle conservation and awareness, Libaran Island Resort is located 5 minutes from the Selingan Turtle Island and gets its fair share of nesting turtles. Taking it upon themselves to protect these turtles and their eggs, Libaran Resort has an in-house turtle hatchery where the local community and visitors can drop by during the day for a visit, and help release new turtle hatching's at night.
				</p>
				<p>
				Tents are equipped with comfortable beds, a small desk, and clean linen sheets. Bask in the island sun at the sun deck, discover the trails with some jungle trekking, or cool off with a swim or snorkel and return to the comfort of hot showers at the shared bathrooms.
