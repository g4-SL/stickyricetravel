				<p>Immerse yourself in nature's best, without having to compromise the rest. Borneo Nature Lodge strives to be an eco-friendly resort without having to compromise the green or your comfort.
				<p>Nestled along the riverbanks of the Kinabatangan River, spend your days cruising down river in search of wildlife, explore the inner chambers of Gomantong Cave, and watch our primate cousins feed while at the Sepilok Orang-Utan Centre.</p>
				<p>Bird enthusiast can make base at the lodge's 3 storey viewing tower, which doubles as a vantage point and solar tower. While on ground level, there are mechanical bicycle pedals mounted to the ground that visitors may cycle on to charge up the lodge's battery banks, as the lodge runs on stored solar power at night.</p>
				<p>Return after a full day of activities to the luxury of air-conditioned rooms without the worry of guilt, as guest are encouraged to turn on their air-conditioning in order to heat the hot water showers. Another home comfort to be enjoyed worry-free.</p> 
				<p>Other green practices at the lodge include, installing glass panels into the rooms and restaurant to allow for natural light to flow in, harvesting rain water for toilets and watering, grease traps located at the wash area to prevent grease from being discharged into the river, composting, and producing their own fruit peel enzyme.</p>
