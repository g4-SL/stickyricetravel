				<p>Nanga Sumpa is a jungle lodge located in a relatively remote area of Borneo. The facilities reflect the remote location and are somewhat basic, and accommodation may not be as luxurious as some travellers require. If you are looking for a bit more luxury, the Batang Ai Longhouse Resort by Hilton offers hotel standard facilities and air-conditioned rooms.</p>
				<p>Nanga Sumpa lodge serves as a base for a range of nature-based activities and excursions and offers visitors the chance of learning about the culture and lifestyle of the Iban community who live in the nearby longhouse. Activities at Nanga Sumpa include travelling further upriver by longboat to have a swim at a waterfall; visiting the longhouse and surrounding farms; participating in the daily activities of the Iban people; and jungle trekking on trails that take you along streams and through farmlands to primary rainforest.</p>
