					A visit to Tabin Wildlife Reserve is highly recommended if wildlife is the focus of your Borneo trip. A nature and wildlife reserve created in 1984 to preserve Sabah's disappearing wild animals and their habitat, the reserve occupies a large part of the peninsula forming the northern headland of Darvel Bay, located 48 kilometers east of Lahad Datu. Tabin is Sabah's largest wildlife reserve, a sanctuary that covers 112,000 hectares, of which 9000 hectares, the core area, is primary unlogged forest. The remainder is logged, regenerating forests bordered by oil palm which attracts the wildlife, and herein, lies the irony. 
				</p>	
				<p>
					Mammals like the clouded leopard and Malayan sunbear prefer the deeper shade of primary forest; less dense forest floor makes it easier for moving around compared to regenerating forests. In the evening however, civets, wild cats and wild boar leave their forest homes to forage among the oil palms. Hornbills and monkeys feast on the fruit during the day.
				</p>	
				<p>
					Tabin is a truly wildlife hotspot; all 8 species of hornbills in Borneo have been recorded here and on any visit you will likely to see at least 3 species - the resident family of White Crowned Hornbill, Rhinoceros Hornbill and Wrinkled Hornbill. The neighbouring oil palm fruit provide a wonderful supplement to their normal diet. The Borneo Pygmy Elephant is often seen across the river from the resort and gibbons' calls wake you up in the morning - an early morning walk offers the opportunity to see these agile creatures.
				</p>		
				<p>
					Tabin Wildife Resort was set up in 1999 along the shallow banks of the Lipad River. One of Tabin's important features is the mineral sources including at least 3 mud volcanoes. These areas serve as mineral salt licks for many wildlife and perhaps it is for this reason that such a great diversity of large mammals including elephants, wild cattle (Tembadau), and bearded pigs as well as a number of predators, continue to thrive in Tabin. During your visit here, you will trek to one of the mud volcano and visit a waterfall, and go on night drives in search of nocturnal wildlife - it is not unusual to see civets and leopard cats foraging along the roadside on night drives.

				<h2 class="grunge5">Responsible Traveler</h2>
				<div class="bgw pad">
					<ul class="l1">
						<li>
							Be aware that you will be in a reserve area and a sensitive environment. Consider your actions:
						</li>
						<li>
							Cut out plastic - remove and recycle plastic packaging of new travel gear before you pack, and bring a light cotton or string bag for your shopping so you can politely refuse plastic bags at shops and markets.
						</li>
						<li>
							Try to bring rechargeable batteries as disposable batteries leach toxic chemicals as they degrade in landfill, and recycling facilities are scarce in some countries.
						</li>
						<li>
							Bring your own metal water bottle. Fill up at restaurants or treat your own water on tour instead of buying lots of plastic bottles. Bear in mind that there may not be recycling facilities available at some destinations.
						</li>
						<li>
							Please do not throw litter in the street or throw it out of the windows while we're travelling. Although the environment may not be as clean as you'd expect it to be at home, there is no reason to make it any worse. Please put your litter in public bins or take it away with you for safe disposal at a suitable place.
						</li>	
						<li>
							Cigarette butts can be conveniently carried away in an empty film container.
						</li>	
						<li>
							During optional activities, take your cues from the expert local guides. Follow their instructions when interacting with wild animals, swimming near coral reefs, walking in popular and pristine areas and visiting ancient sites. Be aware that you may need to take extra care in these areas to respect the natural environment.
