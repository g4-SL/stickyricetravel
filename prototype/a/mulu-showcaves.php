				Gunung Mulu National Park is one of nature's most astounding features in Sarawak’s expanding network of national parks. 
				It is also the largest national park, covering 544 sq km of primary rainforest; criss-crossed by fast flowing rivers and 
				clear jungle streams. Mulu is dominated by three mountains – Gunung Mulu (2,376 m), Gunung Api (1,750 m) and Gunung Benarat 
				(1,858 m), yet many of Mulu's greatest attractions lie deep below the surface. Hidden underneath the forested slopes of these 
				mountains is one of the largest limestone cave system in the world. This system, a breath-taking natural wonder, contains a 
				number of record breaking caves. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				There are 4 showcaves in Mulu - selected for their uniqueness or sheer beauty. They can all be visited as day trips from the 
				park HQ and are accessible by plankwalks and well-lit concrete paths. Strategically positioned spotlights highlight the unique 
				features of the individual caves. A plankwalk leads through the forest to Deer Cave and Lang's Cave whilst Clearwater Cave and 
				Wind Cave are reached by taking a longboat up the Melinau River.

							<th><img src="<?php echo $uf;?>c/day1.png" alt="Day 1 - Day One" /></th>
							<td>
								<b>Arrive Mulu - Deer & Lang Caves</b><br />
								Arrive Mulu airport in the morning and transfer to the park accommodation for check in. 
								In the afternoon, enjoy a scenic 3 km plankwalk through primary rainforest to the entrance 
								of Deer Cave. Deer Cave is the world’s largest cave passage. Its scale its awesome and you 
								are in no doubt how huge it is when you arrive at the cave entrance. The entrance of the 
								cave is 150 m wide and 120 m high. Nowhere in this massive cave is the roof less than 90m high. 
								The cave has a moon-like landscape and from one vantage point, a perfect profile of President 
								Lincoln can be observed. Next to Deer Cave is Lang Cave. The stalactites and stalagmites 
								inside this cave are representative of the very best limestone formations in the park. 
								After viewing the two caves, proceed to the Bat Observatory outside Deer Cave. Most evenings at sundown, 
								a spectacular exodus of about 2 million of bats can be observed as they leave the cave in search of food. 
								Then trek back to the park HQ by torchlight and return to accommodation.

							<th><img src="<?php echo $uf;?>c/day2.png" alt="Day 2 - Day Two" /></th>
							<td>
								<b>Clearwater &amp; Wind Caves</b><br />
								In the morning, proceed by longboat upriver to Wind Cave with its impressive 'King's Chamber'. Here, stalactites and stalagmites with 
								delicate lace-like patterns are found. A short walk along a plankwalk next to the limestone cliff followed by a climb up approximately 
								250 concrete steps and you arrive at the entrance to Clearwater Cave. Like most caves in Mulu, Clearwater Cave provides a habitat for 
								unique species of plants. One of these, the one-leafed plant can only be found at Mulu. Photo-sensitive algae grow on certain rocks and 
								produce needle-like formations that point towards the source of light. Near Clearwater Cave there is a wonderful swimming area shaded by 
								giant rainforest trees. Enjoy a simple picnic or packed lunch, swim or relax before returning to your accommodation. The rest of the 
								afternoon is free at your leisure.
