					Our forte is custom-made itineraries based on clients' specific interests and travel­style, and all clients are assigned a travel consultant who will correspond with client on building the itinerary from beginning to end. All our consultants have traveled extensively in their specific areas of assignment, and have the ability to craft programs, suggest advice and recommendations to suit your travel preferences.

					Our high-end custom trips put you close to nature in the comfort of tasteful or luxury accommodations wherever possible, secluded destinations, be escorted by the best guides and even attend lecture or talk on conservation efforts in Borneo by experts in their fields. Sometimes, they also go on aerial helicopter tours of Mt Kinabalu or the Borneo rainforest.
					<br /><br />
					For the more adventurous at heart, we can customize a wild Borneo experience for you, be it multi­day trek across less inhabited jungles with local tribes, rapid shooting into Kalimantan, white water kayaking and other off the beaten track areas that are hardly visited by other people. You only need to ask - we can connect travelers to local communities for heightened interaction, allowing more insight into the fast disappearing cultures of this area.
					<br /><br />
					Or maybe you're tired of traveling and want something more to define your travels? If you would like to give back - we could easily build in a community project into your Borneo itinerary. We have spent many years building relationships with the communities that we work with to better understand their needs and challenges, and how we can help or connect others to impact them positively through tourism.
