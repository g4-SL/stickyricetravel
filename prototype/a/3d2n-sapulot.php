					Venturing into the lesser-known Sapulot country means encountering Murut hospitality; drink bottomless rice wine from huge ceramic jars and chat about their headhunting ancestors. The Muruts were the last of the ethnic groups in Sabah to renounce headhunting.	
				</p>	
				<p>
					Scale a 800 feet limestone pinnacle, explore mysterious caves and sleep on stretcher hammocks in a jungle camp perched high on a riverbank. Enjoy traditional Murut food and navigate rivers that run through pristine rainforest in traditional longboats, 'perahu'. Cross a river and trek to reach a hidden waterfall, and sleep in a charming hut by the waterfall. Want more? Go rapid shooting and cross the border into Kalimantan to see sleepy villages and isolated longhouses deep in the heart of Borneo.	
				</p>	
				<p>
					Sapulot is tucked inland from the coast and one of Sabah's best-kept secret when it comes to discovering villages, nature and culture. Not many venture here but if you do, it is likely that you wont see another tourist or traveler.
