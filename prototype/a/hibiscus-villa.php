				<p>If you are looking for an idyllic beach getaway to relax with family and friends for a few days without sacrificing comfort and luxury, and wanting to get away from the big resorts, Hibiscus Villa is the place for you. A holiday villa nestled amongst a former coconut plantation on the north coast of Sabah, near the Tip of Borneo. The 6,000 sq foot Hibiscus Villa sleeps up to 8 persons (6+2) and boasts large open living spaces both inside and out. With an airy, open-plan style throughout, there is plenty of space for relaxing, dining, sleeping and swimming. The focal point of the 2 acre property is the 18m infinity pool and guests can walk through the gardens to access its secluded white sandy beach.</p>

				<table class="tbl_p">
					<tr>
						<td>You can explore the numerous beaches and bays, walk to the Tip of Borneo, try your skills at fishing, go snorkelling, or even try a trek through the forest areas nearby. It is possible to pre-arrange a range of activities during your stay at the villa including mangrove river cruise, scuba diving, fishing or boat trips, jungle trekking including survival course, visit the Rungus museum where the traditions and culture of the local Rungus people can be explained, or a day out with a local in their farms â€“ rice planting, rubber tapping, foreshore seafood foraging, rice de-husking, collecting coconuts, fishing with hand-nets. However, bear in mind that these activities are seasonal and dependent on the locals being able to take you with them. If all that sounds too stressful for you, massage and spa treatments are also available upon requests.</td>
