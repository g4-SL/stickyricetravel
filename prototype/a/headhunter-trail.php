				Discover the show caves of Mulu National Park, climb the Pinnacles and trek the headhunters' trail on a 5 day/4 night tour of 
				the Mulu UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Headhunter's Trail is a great way of entering or leaving Gunung Mulu National Park. 
				The trek combines upriver travel, jungle trekking and an overnight stay at an Iban longhouse. The trail itself follows the 
				route taken by Kayan headhunting parties who paddled up the Melinau River to Melinau Gorge. They then dragged their longboats 
				through the forest for 3 km until they reached the banks of the Terikan River, where they launched headhunting raids against 
				the people of the Limbang area. This trek offers an excellent introduction to the rivers and rainforest of Mulu, with the added 
				attraction of the Pinnacle climb and longhouse stay.

								<b>Arrive Mulu – Deer &amp; Lang Caves</b><br />
								Arrive Mulu airport in the morning and transfer to the park accommodation for check in. In the afternoon enjoy a scenic 3 km plankwalk through primary rainforest to the entrance of Deer Cave. Deer Cave is the world’s largest cave passage. Its scale its awesome and you are in no doubt how huge it is when you arrive at the cave entrance. The entrance of the cave is 150 m wide and 120 m high. Nowhere in this massive cave is the roof less than 90 m high. The cave has a moon-like landscape and from one vantage point, a perfect profile of President Lincoln can be observed. Next to Deer Cave is Langs Cave. The stalactites and stalagmites inside this cave are representative of the very best limestone formations in the park. After viewing the two caves, proceed to the Bat Observatory outside Deer Cave. Most evenings at sundown, a spectacular exodus of about 2 million of bats can be observed as they leave the cave in search of food. Then trek back to the park HQ by torchlight and return to accommodation.

								<b>Wind &amp; Clearwater Caves – Camp 5</b><br /> 
								In the morning, proceed by longboat upriver to Wind Cave with its impressive ‘King’s Chamber’. Here, stalactites and stalagmites with delicate lace-like patterns are found. A short walk along a plankwalk next to the limestone cliff followed by a climb up approximately 250 concrete steps and you arrive at the entrance to Clearwater Cave. Like most caves in Mulu, Clearwater Cave provides a habitat for unique species of plants.  One of these, the one-leafed plant can only be found at Mulu. Photo-sensitive algae grow on certain rocks and produce needle-like formations that point towards the source of light. Near Clearwater Cave there is a wonderful swimming area shaded by giant rainforest trees. Enjoy a simple picnic or packed lunch. After lunch proceed to Long Litut (1 hr boat ride). Start trekking to Camp 5 (3 hrs) through a mixed dipterocarp and riparian forest. Overnight at Camp 5 which offers basic dormitory accommodation with basic common toilet facilities.
