					One of the most picturesque villages on the Kinabatangan, Abai village is located 
					closest to the river mouth that pours itself out onto the Sulu Sea. Reachable only 
					by a 2 hours boat ride from Sandakan pier (60km), the ride itself promises 
					enchanting views of mangrove forests that line the coastal area before the river 
					snakes its way onto the Kinabatangan Floodplain.
				</p>
				<p>
					Abai homestay is a community tourism initiative with direct empowerment and 
					economic benefits to its community. Aside from wildlife, this trip will give you 
					the opportunity to interact with local Orang Sungai, the biggest ethnic group that 
					calls the Kinabatangan their home. Once mostly fishermen, alternative livelihoods 
					today include tourism, small enterprises and a combination of government and 
					conservation NGO jobs that was created when the floodplain was gazetted as a 
					protected area. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You will be welcomed into your host family home - experience the hospitality of 
					traditional Orang Sungai and participate in their day-to-day activities such as 
					fishing using fishtraps, planting rice or traditional boat making. Learn about 
					community conservation efforts in preserving their sensitive environment - plant a
					tree and support their carbon-offset program. Help your host cook a traditional 
					meal and eat your meals with the family.

				<div class="bgw pad">
					<p>
					The communities of Orang Sungai that inhabit the Kinabatangan Floodplain are 
					conservative and Muslim. Please be sensitive to the local culture:
					</p>
					<p>
					Adhere to a modest dress code - for women, recommended shorts are 
					around knee-length (or cover most thigh areas) and no low-cut or too tight fitting tops. It is highly recommended to cover shoulders. Men should never 
					go without a shirt regardless of how humid you think the local weather is - 
					this is considered rude and a sure-fire way of not being accepted in rural 
					areas.
					</p>
					<p>
					Public display of affection is frowned upon and should be avoided at all 
					times.
					</p>
					<p>
					Do not bring any alcohol into the village with you and never entertain any 
					invitation by locals or tourist to consume alcohol within the village.
					</p>
					<p>
					Never give money to children or anyone in the village unless it is part of 
					gratuities or tips. Instead, consider supporting in sustainable ways by 
					supporting programs and projects by the community or NGOs that work 
					with them.
