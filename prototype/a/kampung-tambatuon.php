				The perfect setting for rest and relaxation, Tambatuon is located on the foothills of Mount Kinabalu, in a beautiful valley by the Kedamaian River. Paddy fields and fruit orchards aplenty, discover the amazing hospitality of the Dusun tribe - the biggest ethnic group in Sabah.
				</p>
				<p>
				Settle into your accommodation by the banks of the Kedamaian River - a longhouse equipped with private rooms, dorms, common area, kitchen, shared bathroom facility and spacious verandah facing the mountain and river. Trek to a nearby river for swimming and relaxation, wander around the quaint village paddy fields and hanging bridges, practice rubber tree tapping, or simply sprawl out on the deck by the river and eat tasty food cooked by a local Dusun family.

				<h2 class="grunge5">Responsible Traveler</h2>
				<div class="bgw pad">
					<p>
						Be sensitive to your environment and minimize your travel impact. Follow tips and guidelines as recommended by us.
					</p>
					<p>
						Bring a water bottle so you do not have to purchase plastic bottles. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Never give money to children or anyone in the village unless it is part of gratuities or tips. Instead, consider supporting in sustainable ways by supporting programs and projects by the community or NGOs that work with them. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Consider your action before taking plastic bags with you. There may not be recycling facilities in rural areas and most of the time plastic bags end up in rivers and landfills.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Dusun people in this area are mostly non-Muslim so rice wine is part and parcel of a celebration. It is OK to consume alcohol in this area.
