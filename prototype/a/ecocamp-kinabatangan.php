					The Eco Camp sits on the banks of an Oxbow Lake - the only accommodation on the Kinabatangan that is located in a forest reserve. It is lovely but bear in mind basic - there is no electricity during the day and low voltage LED bulbs provide lights during the night. Each raised A-frame huts sleep 2 comfortably - all bedding including mosquito net provided. There is a spacious platform outside for nature and wildlife observation. Western-style showers and toilets are communal, and meals are served buffet-style at the eating lounge by the lake. Wildlife aside, you will have the chance to visit a forest restoration project along with other programs run by the community in trying to preserve their sensitive environment.

				<h2 class="grunge6">Responsible Traveler</h2>
				<div class="bgw pad">
					<p>
					The communities of Orang Sungai that inhabit the Kinabatangan Floodplain are conservative and Muslim. Please be sensitive to the local culture:
					</p>

					<p>
					Adhere to a modest dress code - for women, recommended shorts are around knee-length (or cover most thigh areas) and no low-cut or too tight-fitting tops. It is highly recommended to cover shoulders. Men should never go without a shirt regardless of how humid you think the local weather is - this is considered rude and a sure-fire way of not being accepted in rural areas. 
					</p>

					<p>
					Public display of affection is frowned upon and should be avoided at all times.
					</p>

					<p>
					Do not bring any alcohol into the village with you and never entertain any invitation by locals or tourist to consume alcohol within the village.
					</p>

					<p>
					Never give money to children or anyone in the village unless it is part of gratuities or tips. Instead, consider supporting in sustainable ways by supporting programs and projects by the community or NGOs that work with them.
					</p>
