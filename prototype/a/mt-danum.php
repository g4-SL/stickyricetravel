					For the more adventurous, take visiting Danum Valley a step further and enter the interior of the valley.
					There are satellite camps set up on a trail network that lets you explore deep into the conservation area, 
					walking where few have walked before. The trekking can be tough, but the reward is high as you get to see 
					pristine forest, wildlife, and beautiful waterfalls. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This is an expedition style adventure. You will be sleeping in basic stretcher hammocks or expedition hammocks, 
					food is good but simple, and our guides are excellent.
