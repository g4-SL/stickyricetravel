				The Tunku Abdul Rahman Park (TARP) is the underwater playground of Kota Kinabalu. Situated in the South China Sea, TARP is located only a short boat ride away from this vibrant city's waterfront. This is your location for exploring the local reefs and getting a glimpse of the outstanding variety of colorful fish and corals endemic to West Sabah. Gazetted as a National park in 1974, TARP was the first of Sabah's protected marine parks and is therefore home to countless species of marine life, as well as a healthy coral reef ecosystem. With 25 different dive sites spread between five different tropical islands. This trip caters to divers of all experience levels. Even those uninitiated to the magic of SCUBA can participate in a PADI Discover SCUBA Diving* experience.

								Your Dive Guide will go through with you the dive trip itinerary for the day. You will need to fill in the required PADI liability forms on your first day of diving. You will then be shown your dive equipment which will already be set up for you. The PADI Instructor will then provide a full dive briefing for your first dive. You and your dive buddy will do buddy checks before starting your first dive of the day. Enjoy a nice, long relaxing dive (dive length is maximum 60 minutes, or minimum 50 bar). If you are doing a 3 dive trip, your second dive of the day will be before lunch (with a minimum 1 hour surface interval between dives). This will mean your lunch will be at 1pm and you will be back at Jesselton Point Jetty at approx. 4:30pm.

Your Dive Guide will provide a briefing for your second/third dive. Get your dive gear ready and go diving along a shallow coral reef. The diving adventure continues! At 3pm, return to the jetty. If you have your own dive equipment, you may leave it on the boat for the remaining diving days of your diving.
