						On June 5, 2015 a 6.0 magnitude earth quake hits Sabah claiming 18 lives comprising of climbers and mountain guides. The epicentre of the quake was 54 km from the world UNESCO site of Mount Kinabalu, standing at 4,095 meters. Strong tremors were felt in Kota Kinabalu city and most of the northwestern area of the state when the earth quake struck at 7.15AM local time. More than a hundred climbers were stranded on the summit following the strong tremors, triggering landslides and streams of falling rocks and boulders rendering the summit route impenetrable.<br /><br />
						Clearance and reconstruction for the new summit route has begun, and the mountain is expected to be re-open to the public by September. Numbers of climbers will be limited for the early stages of its re-opening taking 90 climbers a day rather than the 192 climbers permitted daily.<br /><br />
						Due to this, all bookings for Mt Kinabalu Climb and Via Ferrata has been cancelled until further notice, bookings for September are not open yet. Thank you for your patience and understanding.<br /><br />
						Our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those lost in the wake of this tragedy.<br /><br />
						For climbers who have paid and confirmed their climbing dates, and now unable to climb, we will be providing alternative destination options or refunds. Our consultants will be in touch with you shortly if they have not already.

								You will be met by our driver at your hotel in KK at 6.30am for the 2 hours journey to Kinabalu Park. 
								Upon arrival, our driver will assist with registration and fees before dropping you off at Timpohon Gate, 
								the start of climb, with your mountain guide. 
								<br /><br />
								The climb on the 1st day is 6km with an elevation gain of about 1,300 meters. This takes 3-5 hours depending on 
								fitness, and there are rest stops with toilets along the way. We recommend bringing enough drinking water for 
								your climb on this day. There are opportunities to refill your water bottles on the way up but the water is not 
								treated - water purification tablets or iodine can come in handy for this. Upon arrival at the accommodation, you 
								will have access to filtered water. Along the way, observe the fascinating montane forest with pitcher plants, 
								rhododendrons and orchids. Upon arrival at Pendant Hut, check into your accommodation and attend the mandatory 
								via ferrata briefing before settling in. Dinner is between 4.30-6.30pm and lights out at 8pm.
