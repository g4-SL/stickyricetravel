					Lankayan is a small tropical island in the Sulu Sea, about 90 minutes by boat from the port of Sandakan, and sits within a large Marine Protected Area with excellent diving. 
					Unpopulated and circled by white sandy shore, Lankayan is also exquisitely private, perfect for honeymooners and anyone seeking peace and tranquillity. The only resort on the island, 
					it was built in 1997, it also boast a privately-managed conservation area where your tourism-dollars go a little bit further - a percentage of what you pay go into its conservation 
					fund to sustain the patrolling of boats by locally trained wardens, turtle hatchery, and other marine conservation efforts activities.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Accommodation consists of wooden chalets right on the beach and rooms are airy. Every chalet has its own private balcony and direct access to the beach.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Delicious fresh meals and snacks are available throughout the day in the central building with its lovely terrace. The emphasis is on locally caught seafood, with barbecues held at the bar.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Diving here is wonderful, with a centre run by professional dive-professionals; for divers up to 3 boat dives per day is included, or you can simply buddy up and dive the house reef. Snorkelling and kayaking are also on offer.
