					One of the most picturesque villages on the Kinabatangan, Abai village is located closest to the river mouth that pours itself out onto the Sulu Sea. Reachable only by a 2 hour boat ride from Sandakan pier (60km), the ride itself promises enchanting views of mangrove forests that line the coastal area before the river snakes its way onto the Kinabatangan Floodplain.
				</p>
				<p>
					Abai homestay is a community tourism initiative with direct empowerment and economic benefits to its community. Aside from wildlife, this trip will give you the opportunity to interact with local Orang Sungai, the biggest ethnic group that calls the Kinabatangan their home. Once mostly fishermen, alternative livelihoods today include tourism, small enterprises and a combination of government and conservation NGO jobs that was created when the floodplain was gazetted as a protected area.
				</p>
				<p>
					You will be welcomed into your host family home - experience the hospitality of traditional Orang Sungai and participate in their day-to-day activities such as fishing using fishtraps, planting rice or traditional boat making. Learn about community conservation efforts in preserving their sensitive environment - plant a tree and support their carbon-offset program. Help your host cook a traditional meal and eat your meals with the family.

								Pick up at Sandakan or Sepilok hotel at 8am, and transfer to Sandakan jetty for the 2 hour boat ride into Abai. Take in the amazing view of mangrove forests and wildlife as you enter the estuarine area of the Kinabatangan area. Upon arrival at about 11am, register and check-in at your homestay. Get to know your host family and enjoy a hearty home-cooked lunch. 
								<br /><br />
								After lunch, embark on a village sightseeing walk. Get a feel of what life is like for locals by wandering around the village into fruit orchards, school, tree nurseries, or paddy plantation. Try your hands at mending fish nets or traps, craft-making or paddy planting.
								<br /><br />
								During your tea break, listen on to the Community Abai Project (CAP) initiatives on eco-tourism and conservation in the area. After tea time, go on a river cruise to a nearby Oxbow lake to spot wildlife. When you return to the village, help with cooking if you want and eat dinner with your host family.

Look for seedlings in the forest and walk along clearly marked trail with your guide. Participate in tree planting and learn of the Kinabatangan Floodplain's complex ecosystem.
								<br /><br />
								Upon your return to the village, have lunch and germinate seedlings in tree nurseries before relaxing for the afternoon. After tea time, continue to relax on your homestay porch or go fishing and learn traditional prawn trapping. Alternatively, you can also play soccer with the village kids, or watch the sun sets over the river. After dinner, go on a night river safari, spotting fireflies and nocturnal wildlife along the way.

				<h2 class="grunge6">Responsible Traveler</h2>
				<div class="bgw pad">
					<p>
						The communities of Orang Sungai that inhabit the Kinabatangan Floodplain are conservative and Muslim. Please be sensitive to the local culture:
					</p>
					<p>
						Adhere to a modest dress code - for women, recommended shorts are around knee-length (or cover most thigh areas) and no low-cut or too tight fitting tops. It is highly recommended to cover shoulders. Men should never go without a shirt regardless of how humid you think the local weather is - this is considered rude and a sure-fire way of not being accepted in rural areas.
					</p>
					<p>
						Public display of affection is frowned upon and should be avoided at all times.
					</p>
					<p>
						Do not bring any alcohol into the village with you and never entertain any invitation by locals or tourist to consume alcohol within the village.
					</p>
					<p>
						Never give money to children or anyone in the village unless it is part of gratuities or tips. Instead, consider supporting in sustainable ways by supporting programs and projects by the community or NGOs that work with them.
					</p>
