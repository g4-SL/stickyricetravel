					Located in Sukau, Borneo Nature Lodge strives to be an eco-friendly lodge without having to compromise the environment or your comfort. Nestled along the riverbanks of the Kinabatangan River, spend your days cruising down river in search of wildlife, explore the inner chambers of Gomantong Cave, and watch our primate cousins feed while at the Sepilok Orang-Utan Centre. Bird enthusiast can make base at the lodge's 3 storey viewing tower, which doubles as a vantage point and solar tower. While on ground level, there are mechanical bicycle pedals mounted to the ground that visitors may cycle to charge up the lodge's battery banks, as the lodge runs on stored solar power at night.
