						Having booked only our return flights and nothing else, and with only a couple of weeks till the off, I emailed Sticky Rice with an urgent plea to help us plan our itinerary.  Our request was to pack in as many of the main Sabah highlights as possible into our short nine-day trip.  Our wish was granted as, over the course of a few email exchanges, the team managed to maximize our time splendidly. The actual logistics of the trip - getting from here to there and being passed from this driver to that guide - all worked perfectly.  We did not have to worry about a thing, leaving us free to enjoy the many wonders of Borneo. Thank you, Sticky Rice.

						We have spent 3 days in Danum Valley Field Centre with Sticky Rice and it was absolutely amazing! Given that I myself work at a Conservation NGO and one of my friends is a biologist, we were really quite keen on the biodiversity aspect of the trip. Our guide adapted to all our requests, including long night drives and early birdwatching, which allowed us to see around 20 rare species of birds, small mammals and reptiles. The proficiency of our guide was really mindblowing. On top of this, the accommodation and food were also very good, which is impressive in such a remote area. Thumbs up for Sticky Rice!

						We have two weeks in Borneo, I emailed Charlie at Sticky Rice. What should we do? Messages went back and forth and the day after we docked our sailboat at Sutera Harbour in KK Charlie came aboard. The Danum Valley is a really special place, he said. It's a primary rainforest where man has never settled and home to orang utans, gibbons, pygmy elephants, tarsiers and all kinds of other wildlife. What do you think about that? Awesome! What about going to the Kinabutangan River? You can stay in an eco-lodge at Sukau and see proboscis monkeys, macaques, hornbills and more from a boat. Sure! After that you can go diving, do a homestay, or check out the Sepilok orang utan and sun bear conservation centers. Okay! Charlie and the Sticky Rice crew put together a fabulous itinerary with terrific guides that pointed out animals, birds, reptiles and bugs we would not have seen on our own. Our lives are all about travel, but our time in Borneo stands out as a brilliant highlight thanks to Charlie and the Sticky Rice crew.

						We have just got back from a 3 week trip to Borneo.We had a great time.
						My wife &amp; daughter travelled from the UK. I was working in Australia &amp; travelled from there.Arranging accommodation &amp; trips was a bit problematic at times.This was due mainly to communication difficulties &amp; internet limitations.
						When I contacted Jessica at Sticky Rice,this all changed.She replied promptly to all e mail suggestions in clear,concise English. She gave cogent,practical advice &amp; helped me re jig the whole outline of my trip.She also helped with specific accommodation bookings &amp; arranging the river boat trip.She offered guidance &amp; support throughout &amp; even helped sort out car hire for us.
						On our Kinabatangan river trip, we were lucky enough to end up on a boat with Charlie. He was excellent value,both for spotting wildlife of all kinds,identifying it &amp; giving useful local knowledge.
						All in all.we were very impressed with the Sticky Rice team &amp; the services offered us.They were instrumental in making our holiday the thoroughly enjoyable,splendid experience it was.

						If you like to venture away from the typical tourist spots, want to experience something special and come away feeling like you have done so responsibly, Sticky Rice are definitely the people to speak to. I arrived as an independent traveller in Kota Kinabalu without a clue of where to begin with my tour of amazing Borneo.I spent the morning with Charlie and Jess who were extremely helpful in mapping out and customizing my holiday with the most amazing activities from homestays to tree planting to seeing wildlife in their natural habitats. I am extremely grateful for their knowledge, enthusiasm and passion for the the projects they are involved in and I cannot recommend them enough to help you get started with your Borneo plans. I will definitely be using Sticky Rice again!
