					The perfect setting for rest and relaxation, Tambatuon is located on the foothills of Mount Kinabalu, in a beautiful valley by the Kedamaian River. Paddy fields and fruit orchards aplenty, discover the amazing hospitality of the Dusun tribe - the biggest ethnic group in Sabah.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Settle into your accommodation by the banks of the Kedamaian River - a longhouse equipped with private rooms, dorms, common area, kitchen, shared bathroom facility and spacious verandah facing the mountain and river. Trek to a nearby river for swimming and relaxation, wander around the quaint village paddy fields and hanging bridges, practice rubber tree tapping, or simply sprawl out on the deck by the river and eat tasty food cooked by a local Dusun family.
