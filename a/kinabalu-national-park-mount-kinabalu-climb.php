On June 5, 2015 a 6.0 magnitude earth quake hits Sabah claiming 18 lives comprising of climbers and mountain guides. The epicentre of the quake was 54 km from the world UNESCO site of Mount Kinabalu, standing at 4,095 meters. Strong tremors were felt in Kota Kinabalu city and most of the northwestern area of the state when the earth quake struck at 7.15AM local time. More than a hundred climbers were stranded on the summit following the strong tremors, triggering landslides and streams of falling rocks and boulders rendering the summit route impenetrable.<br /><br />
Clearance and reconstruction for the new summit route has begun, and the mountain is expected to be re-open to the public by September. Numbers of climbers will be limited for the early stages of its re-opening taking 90 climbers a day rather than the 192 climbers permitted daily.<br /><br />
Due to this, all bookings for Mt Kinabalu Climb and Via Ferrata has been cancelled until further notice, bookings for September are not open yet. Thank you for your patience and understanding.<br /><br />
Our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those lost in the wake of this tragedy.<br /><br />
For climbers who have paid and confirmed their climbing dates, and now unable to climb, we will be providing alternative destination options or refunds. Our consultants will be in touch with you shortly if they have not already.

											Wake up for an early morning breakfast and make your way to the registration counter by 8am. After meeting your guide and picking up your packed lunch, proceed to Timpohon Gate with your guide to start the climb. The climb on the 1st day is 6km with an elevation gain of about 1,300 meters. This takes 4-6 hours depending on fitness, and there are rest stops with toilets along the way. There are opportunities to refill your water bottles on the way up but since the water is not treated, we recommend water purification tablets or iodine for this. Alternatively, you can stock up on drinking water before commencing your climb. 
											<br /><br />
											Along the way, observe the fascinating montane forest with pitcher plants, rhododendrons and orchids. Stop enroute to eat your packed lunch. Upon arrival at the resthouse in Laban Rata, check into your accommodation and settle in. You will have access to filtered drinking water and will be able to refill your water bottle. Dinner is between 4.30-6.30pm and lights out at 8pm.
