					If you are looking for a no-frills beach getaway in a secluded location, away from the maddening crowd of the marine park of Kota Kinabalu, look no further than Manana Borneo. 
				</p>				
				<p>
					Located on a private bay about slightly over an hour north of Kota Kinabalu, Manana Borneo is an absolute delight and a slice of heaven in a protected bay. Go to sleep in your beachfront hut to the lull of the ocean at night, wake up for a morning swim, lounge on the beach all day, or go out diving or snorkeling in various submerged reefs nearby. Rent a kayak or stand-up paddleboard, and end the day watching the sun go down with a cold beer in your hand. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Manana Borneo is also the perfect place to take your Open Water Diver certification if you are thinking of exploring the underwater world. Big Fin Diver, located on the beach, is a certified PADI diving school offering PADI programs.
