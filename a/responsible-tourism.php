				<h2>Being a responsible operator</h2>
				
				<p>
				We are a proud responsible tourism agency. In everything we do and decisions we make, we consider the:
				</p>
				<h2>Environment</h2>
				<p>
				We respect the delicate balance between tourism and conservation of natural environment - its flora, fauna and landscapes, and engage in conservation projects to do our bit. We choose responsible operators wherever possible in our destinations. We support the minimization of pollution - noise, waste disposal and congestion by handling our waste responsibly and limit our number of guests to small group departures.
				</p>
				<h2>Local cultures </h2>
				<p>
				We believe in not only respecting but promoting local cultures, traditions and built heritage. Sabah is made up of 32 ethnic tribes and Sarawak over 40, an intricate and fascinating medley of culture. Some of these cultures are dying in the face of progress and non-relevancy in terms of the way tourism is positioned here. We are committed to making positive contributions to the conservation and promotion of cultural heritage, are culturally sensitive, engenders respect between tourist and hosts, and builds local pride and confidence.
				</p>
				<h2>Local communities</h2>
				<p>
				We work directly or via partners in involving, empowering and enhancing the well-being of host communities through income generation/benefits, improvisation of working conditions and accessibility to the tourism industry. We support involving local people in decisions that affect their lives and life chances. We aim to provide more enjoyable experiences for travelers through meaningful connections with local people including greater understanding of local and social issues.
				</p>
				<h2>Conservation of natural resources</h2>
				<p>
				At our office we try to be as paperless as possible. At our destinations, we choose tourism outfitters that are geared towards the same values and provide information and tips to our guests on doing the same.

					<h2>Being a responsible visitor</h2>
					
					<p>
					Every visitor makes an impact and you have the choice to make yours a positive one.
					</p>

					<ul class="li-rv">
						<li>
						<p>
						Never give money to beggars or street children because this does not help and only encourage begging habits. Instead, support an organization with a good program that will help these people in changing their lives. 
						</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>
						Be sensitive to local people. They are real people with real lives and privacy, and some may not want their pictures taken. Ask before you snap away on your camera!
						</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>
						Learn the local lingo: Hello, Thank You and Goodbye. You will find that learning a few words of the local language is a great way to break barriers.
						</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>
						Cultural differences do exist and some behaviors that are completely normal at home may not be appropriate locally. Be aware that your behavior do influence local people.
						</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>
						Do not litter! Apply the same rules you do back home when it comes to rubbish and waste.
						</p>
						</li>
