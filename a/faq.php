					        	<li>
					        		<h4>Is it best to pre-book the tours or should I wait until I arrive at my destination?</h4>
					        		<p>It would be best to pre-book as availability may vary. This is especially important during high season (May - August) and Mt Kinabalu Climb bookings. </p>

					        		<h4>What should I do if I have a special dietary requirement?</h4>
					        		<p>Please let us know via email all dietary restrictions and/or allergies prior to your departure, especially if you have critical allergies (nut or wheat). We do our best to convey your dietary restrictions and allergies to our local guides who will relay your information to the chef/cook. In most cases we are able to respond favorably to these requests; however, due to regional limitations, local cuisine or cooking facilities, we may not be able to fulfill all requests. If your dietary needs are critical we recommend you bring a supply of your preferred sustenance to supplement your meals.</p>

					        	<li>
					        		<h4>What type of food do you serve during the trips?</h4>
					        		<p>Breakfasts on our trips are usually buffets with a wide variety of Western and Asian breakfast foods. There is always coffee, green or black tea, juice, milk and water. Lunches and dinners on this trip are usually family-style, as that is the Asian way. This provides you with the most variety of dishes and an opportunity to try many new foods. There will usually be several dishes including meat, fish, seafood, vegetables and rice or noodles. Sometimes you will have a pack lunch enroute to your next destination. Drinking water and soft drinks are included in all meals. Alcoholic beverages such as wine and beer are not included and at your own expense.</p>
					        	</li>
					        	<li>
					        		<h4>Are your tours conducted daily?</h4>
					        		<p>Yes most of our tours are conducted daily, however this will depend on availability and may be affected by public holidays.</p>
					        	</li>
					        	<li>
					        		<h4>When is a good time to visit Sabah Borneo?</h4>
					        		<p>All year round, depending on your interest.</p>
					        	</li>
					        	<li>
					        		<h4>What type of mosquito / insect repellent should I bring or use? </h4>
					        		<p>Insects transmit numerous infectious diseases. Malaria is the most prevalent and pertinent disease in this group, but there are many more. Use an insect repellent containing DEET (N,N diethyl-metatoluamide) to prevent bites of mosquitoes and biting flies. These products have an excellent safety record over decades of use. The best product is probably one of the long-acting preparations with concentrations of 35% or less (e.g., UltraThon Cream by 3M). Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants in the early morning and early evening hours is also a good precaution against bites. </p>
					        	</li>
					        	<li>
					        		<h4>Do I need to obtain a visa before arrival?</h4>
					        		<p>As a USA citizen, you do not require a visa to enter Malaysia as a tourist for up to three months. However, the visa requirements for your trip will vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. It is important that you check for yourself if you have a layover in another country. </p>
					        	</li>
					        	<li>
					        		<h4>What medicines & toiletries should I bring?</h4>
					        		<p>We bring a basic first aid kit for emergencies, but you must bring your own personal first aid supplies. Be sure to bring Moleskin or Second Skin for blisters, as well as Band-Aids and antibiotic ointment. Please discuss this information with your physician, as well as other medications you should bring with you such as antibiotics (Cipro or other), pain killers, allergy medicine (epi-pens for allergic reactions to bee stings), prescription or over-the-counter medications you use regularly, etc. </p>

					        		<h4>Should I bring Malaysian Ringgit with me or change my foreign currency in Malaysia?</h4>
					        		<p>Both are acceptable.</p>
					        	</li>
					        	<li>
					        		<h4>Are credit and charge cards widely accepted in Sarawak & Sabah?</h4>
					        		<p>In cities and in larger hotels, restaurants, and shops, credit cards are readily accepted. The most common credit cards are Visa and MasterCard, and sometimes American Express. It is very easy to access ATMs in all major cities we visit, but keep in mind that outside of the main cities or towns, these are predominantly cash societies. In Kota Kinabalu, you have access to international banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered.</p>
					        	</li>
					        	<li>
					        		<h4>What do I need to pack for my trip?</h4>
					        		<p>Try to go as light as possible and take only the essentials. Remember that due to space limitations in the vehicles and boat, plus weight restrictions on certain flights, your luggage should only weigh 44 pounds. For luggage, we advise travellers to carry a duffel bag or suitcase and a daypack (capacity of 1,500 to 2,000 cubic inches). For clothing, casual clothes suitable for variable weather, preferably made of synthetic materials for easy care, are strongly recommended. Long sleeves are desirable for sun and bug protection during hikes. Do take note that travellers are expected to dress modestly especially in rural areas (eg when visiting local villages) to respect local customs. Other travel essentials for a trip to Borneo are as follows:</p>
