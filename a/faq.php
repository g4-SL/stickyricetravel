					<h2>What should I do if I have a special dietary requirement?</h2>
					<p>
						Please let us know via email all dietary restrictions and/or allergies prior to your departure, especially if you have critical allergies (nut or wheat). We do our best to convey your dietary restrictions and allergies to our local guides who will relay your information to the chef/cook. In most cases we are able to respond favorably to these requests; however, due to regional limitations, local cuisine or cooking facilities, we may not be able to fulfill all requests. If your dietary needs are critical we recommend you bring a supply of your preferred sustenance to supplement your meals.

					<h2>Do I need malaria vaccination or tablets when travelling in Sabah Borneo?</h2>
					<p>
						Malaria is a potential hazard, and you must take medication to suppress malaria infection. It is vital that you consult with your physician to obtain the proper medication. Specific regimens will depend on your travel plans, medical problems, or medication allergies.

					<h2>What type of food do you serve during the trips?</h2>
					<p>
						Breakfasts on this trip are usually buffets with a wide variety of Western and Asian breakfast foods. There is always coffee, green or black tea, juice, milk and water. Lunches and dinners on this trip are usually family-style, as that is the Asian way. This provides you with the most variety of dishes and an opportunity to try many new foods. There will usually be several dishes including meat, fish, seafood, vegetables and rice or noodles. Sometimes you will have a pack lunch enroute to your next destination. Drinking water and soft drinks are included in all meals. Alcoholic beverages such as wine and beer are not included and at your own expense.

					<h2>What type of mosquito / insect repellent should I bring or use?</h2>
					<p>
						Insects transmit numerous infectious diseases. Malaria is the most prevalent and pertinent disease in this group, but there are many more. Use an insect repellent containing DEET (N,N diethyl-metatoluamide) to prevent bites of mosquitoes and biting flies. These products have an excellent safety record over decades of use. The best product is probably one of the long-acting preparations with concentrations of 35% or less (e.g., UltraThon Cream by 3M). Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants in the early morning and early evening hours is also a good precaution against bites.

					<h2>Do I need to obtain a visa before arrival?</h2>
					<p>
						As a USA citizen, you do not require a visa to enter Malaysia as a tourist for up to three months. However, the visa requirements for your trip will vary depending on where you are from and where you are going. It is important that you check for yourself if you have a layover in another country.

					<h2>What footwear do you recommend?</h2>
					<p>
						If your itinerary includes physical activities such as jungle trekking, you will need a good pair of hiking boots/shoes. We usually recommend using Adidas kampung shoes, a Malaysian made rubber shoes, which can be easily bought at a local market for a very cheap price.

					<h2>What medicines &amp; toiletries should I bring?</h2>
					<p>
						We bring a basic first aid kit for emergencies, but you must bring your own personal first aid supplies. Be sure to bring Moleskin or Second Skin for blisters, as well as Band-Aids and antibiotic ointment. Please discuss this information with your physician, as well as other medications you should bring with you such as antibiotics (Cipro or other), pain killers, allergy medicine (epi-pens for allergic reactions to bee stings), prescription or over-the-counter medications you use regularly, etc.

					<h2>Are credit and charge cards widely accepted in Sarawak &amp; Sabah?</h2>
					<p>
						In cities and in larger hotels, restaurants, and shops, credit cards are readily accepted. The most common credit cards are Visa and MasterCard, and sometimes American Express. It is very easy to access ATMs in all major cities we visit, but keep in mind that outside of the main cities or towns, these are predominantly cash societies. In Kota Kinabalu, you have access to international banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered.

					<h2>Electricity at Malaysia?</h2>
					<p>
						Malaysia is on the 230/240 volts system and uses the British Standard BS 1363 domestic AC power plugs and sockets. If you’re planning to use an electric device, bring a converter and a selection of plug adapters (you can buy these in drugstores or travel specialty stores in the US).

					<h2>Are there any laundry services at Borneo?</h2>

					<h2>How do I get phone services?</h2>
					<p>
						Telephones, Internet access, and fax machines are available at most hotels, but sometimes connection can be more challenging in remote areas. Keep in mind that phone calls placed at the hotels can be expensive. Cell phones can usually get a signal at most places, but in some remote areas such as Danum Valley, the signal is quite weak.
						<br /><br />
						If you choose, you can easily purchase inexpensive cell phones with your guide’s assistance. You can also bring your mobile phone or other electronic device. Check with your provider to see it if it will work in Southeast Asia. If so, you can buy a SIM card locally for making international calls from Malaysia. For assistance, speak with your trip coordinator or guide.

					<h2>What type of immunization do I need to get prior to my travel?</h2>
					<p>
						Regulations and recommendations change frequently, so we advise you to check with your local health department or the CDC. Currently, if you fly directly from the US or Europe, no vaccinations are required. Discuss your travel plans and personal health with a health-care provider to determine which vaccines you will need. Ask your doctor for an International Certificate of Vaccination (“yellow card”), and have your immunizations entered on the certificate. The certificate acts as proof of your immunization history. In addition, it will help you keep track of all the immunizations you have received throughout the years.
						<br /><br />
						We recommend that you carry a first aid kit as well as any personal medical requirements (including a spare pair of glasses) as they may not easily be obtained at the locations on this trip. For legal reasons our trip leader and guides are prohibited from administering any type of drugs including headache tablets and antibiotics. Please ensure that you are adequately prepared.
