					<h2>Is it safe to book with Amazing Borneo or any other website sources?</h2>

						Corporate world drop out, Jessica left the constraints of the corporate desk to head back to her hometown in search of something more. But the journey home was longer than expected, as she made a detour backpacking through Europe, Asia and then residing in Vietnam for a few years as a rock-climbing assistant, before finally making the move home to Kota Kinabalu. Once home she was quick to plunge into the deep blue becoming a dive master in just 8 months. She has an inescapable itch for the outdoors, but has found a balance by spending half her time at the Sticky Rice Office and the other out guiding National Geographic Adventure’s Indochina destinations. What excites her the most when travelling is the people and culture, the common thread among communities’ worlds away.

						Sometimes, things just fall into place by accident. Signed up for a global volunteer program in Indonesia, the program was re-routed for Sabah, Borneo where Charlie would unknowingly reside for the next 8 years. On the Kinabatangan he assisted in setting up community initiative programs for the community at Abai Village, in 2008 and then later working with the Penan Community in Sarawak. It was also during his time on the Kinabatangan that he and Atteh, our Sticky Rice Travel Nature Guide, first met. Guiding for National Geographic Adventure groups in Bornoe, Charlie also trains our nature guides providing them with first hand knowledge and experience. Besides guiding, he is also an avid photographer, which goes hand in hand with his passion for wildlife, culture and travel.
