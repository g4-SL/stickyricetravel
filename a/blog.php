				<h1>Adventures in Murut Country, Sapulot</h1>

				<p>
					Over a long weekend we ventured into Murut Country in Sapulot, home to the Muruts who were once well-known for 
					their headhunting ways. The last of the tribes in Sabah to renounce headhunting, most of them today still 
					inhabit the jungles of Sabah in small pockets of communities, dotting inland riverbanks. Their thatched-roof 
					longhouses, woven bamboo baskets and singing hill myna conjure up romantic notions of traditional living, far 
					from the noise and hodgepodge of modern city life. The Muruts we visited welcomed us with hearty feasts, rice 
					wines and an extraordinary exciting adventure on their home grounds.
				</p>

				<p class="pt10">
					Modern civilization becomes more sparse as our car rolls past Keningau, and enters the frontier of Sabah. We pass villages 
					as the road winds through valleys and over hills to Sapulot. Trees abound wherever you look. We turned right into a meandering 
					dirt road, crossing bridges and streams, passing curious glances and smiley faces along the way. It finally brings us to the 
					Longhouse in Kampung Romol. On arrival, our lovely hosts prepared a Murut dinner feast of venison and jungle ferns. The full 
					moon made an appearance and out on the open lawn of the Longhouse, we sit contemplating life on full bellies.

				<h1>Travel</h1>

				<p>
					Tonight at my group's introduction dinner I declared myself a Romantic. I recited 'Travel' by Edna Vincent Millay as a welcoming gesture, a symbol of the beginning of our travels through Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, once known as Indochina.
				</p>

				<p class="pt10">
					When I was living in New York City I became obsessed with books and literature. In my revelation I found Blake and Millay. I admired their works and regarded both as rebels with causes - what I have always wanted to be. So some of Blake's words found their way onto my right calf to feed my tattoo addiction. Now living in Asia, my days browsing in bookstores are long gone; the book titles on the shelves seem mundane. Riddled with the realities of day to day life, I forget my fascination with words that once brought me plenty of joy and satisfaction.
				</p>

				<p class="pt10">
					And now, inspired by Joe whom I recently met during the first trip, I thought hard about poems I liked. This one struck a certain chord when I first developed an appetite for travel.
				</p>

				<p class="pt10">
					<b>'Travel' by Edna Vincent Millay</b><br /><br />
					The railroad track is miles away<br />
					And the day is loud with voices speaking<br />
					Yet there isn't a train goes by all day<br />
					But I hear its whistle shrieking
					<br /><br />
					All night there isn't a train goes by<br />
					Though the night is still for sleeping and dreaming<br />
					But I see its cinders red on the sky<br />
					And hear its engine steaming
					<br /><br />
					My heart is warm with friends I make<br />
					And better friends I'll not be knowing<br />
					Yet there isn't a train I wouldn't take<br />
					No matter where it's going

				<h1>Horsfield's Tarsier (Cephalopachus bancanus)</h1>

				<p>
					This little mammal is one of our nocturnal residents that bounces from tree to tree. This tarsier has been placed in a separate genus from the tarsiers found in the Philippines and Sulawesi. They feed mainly on insects, but are also known to eat bats and reptiles. We usually find them at night, common in the Kinabatangan and in the Danum Valley, sitting on small trees looking for their next meal. These little primates also have the ability to rotate their heads over 180 degrees. We like tarsiers so much that we decided to make them our logo. Hopefully if you come to visit Borneo, you will have an opportunity to see Horsfield's Tarsier in the wild with us!
