					If you are an avid diver and your focus in the Semporna Archipelago is diving Sipadan and its surrounding waters, then look no further than Seaventures. What was once an exploration jack up rig is now a rig ‘resort’, furnished with simple and basic accommodation but has everything you need to make your stay comfortable and will make sure you get the most out of your diving. We believe that Seaventures offers the best value without compromising standards and qualities when it comes to diving safety and accommodation arrangements. An excellent house reef (with an elevator that lowers you directly into it!), well run and organized dive station with professional dive team (5-Star PADI IDC, comfortable rooms with air-conditioning and hot showers, sundeck, bar, and barbeque nights).
				</p>	
				<p>
					If you are a certified diver, Seaventures offers free unlimited house reef diving - just help yourself to a tank and a buddy and enjoy a leisurely dive in your own time and pace. Not a diver yet? Their dive center offers PADI Open Water Course, and a myriad of others to advance your diving hobby or career. Stay a minimum of 4D3N to have access to Sipadan permits (upon availability).
