					The Kinabalu Camping program takes you to a little used substation of Kinabalu National Park, with vast jungle, a temperate climate, and an abundance of biodiversity. Located at 1,080 meters above sea level, the primary rainforest is filled with orchids, giant trees and waterfalls. The campsite is along a beautiful mountain river, with western toilets and showers just a short walk from the basecamp.
