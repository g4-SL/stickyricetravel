				<h1>Danum Valley Conservation Area</h1>
				<p>
				If you are a wildlife and nature geek, you will find paradise in Danum Valley - a 472km sq conservation area of pristine, mostly primary, lowland dipterocarp forest that is home to 300 species of birds, mammals, insects etc. The area boasts an amazing diversity of animal life including the Borneo pygmy elephant, sun bear, orang utan and clouded leopard. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Lose yourself in the immense beauty of untouched nature as you watch the sun rises atop huge tree canopies. Your days will be spent walking and trekking in the forest in hope of seeing a mother orang utan with her baby, Wallace's flying frog, Borneon Gibbon, Rhinoceros Hornbill or the elusive Clouded Leopard. Trek to many waterfalls and learn of forest regeneration and understand the complexity of the 130 million year old rainforest in one of the last places of its kind.

				The Danum Valley Conservation Area is about 2 and a half hours drive from the town of Lahad Datu that is accessible via public bus and plane (Lahad Datu airport). Yayasan Sabah manages the Danum Valley Conservation Area and there are only TWO accommodation options for nature visitors of the area.
