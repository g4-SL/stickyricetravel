								Picked up from your hotel in Kota Kinabalu at 7am for a 2 hours drive to the Kundasang Highland. En-route, enjoy a coffee or tea break at Nabalu Highland area markets, catching a morning view of Mount Kinabalu if the weather permits from the lookout point.

Cycle on various off road terrain to explore the Mount Kinabalu foothill area – gravel, rocky, muddy, technical, long downhill or steep climb. You will pass through huge areas of vegetable plantations.	
								<br /><br />
								Stop for lunch at a local café or packed lunch depending on your route and speed. Your ride will end around 2pm – enjoy another coffee or tea break before departing back to Kota Kinabalu, arriving at about 4pm.
