						The Kiulu Fun &amp; Green program is suitable for those who want an active cycling day in the countryside, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Journey out of the city into the Kiulu area and discover beautiful sceneries as you cycle through hanging bridges, farms and villages.

									Picked up from your hotel in Kota Kinabalu at 8am for a 1.5 hours drive to the Kiulu area. Upon arrival, your cycling guide will conduct a safety briefing, dos &amp; donâ€™ts and assign bicycles. Embark on a fun journey on village terrains and cross as many as four hanging bridges including gravel terrain for at least 1.5km length. Stop at a local Dusun home in Tombung Village for light refreshment and visit their farms to see what life is like for the locals here. Try your hands at rubber-tapping! The ride ends at the river where lunch will be served. Take a refreshing swim in the river before transferring back to Kota Kinabalu at about 2.30pm.
									<br /><br />
									If you want more, it is possible to request for a 7km extension of up and downhill rides for this program.
