						Mount Trus Madi is Sabah's 2nd highest peak, and located in the central part of Sabah, the Crocker Range Park covering 1,400sq kilometers. With an abundance of birds, orchids, and nepenthes you will be rewarded with beautiful views as you follow the trail from the village of Sinua to the summit of Trus Madi. Unlike Mount Kinabalu, very few tourists venture here, especially on the longer 3 nights trail so a visit here will prove to be very special as well as challenging.
