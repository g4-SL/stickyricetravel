					This program allows you to explore the attractions in Sepilok with our nature guide.
				</p>	
				<p>
					The Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Center (SORC) was founded in 1964 to rehabilitate orphaned orangutans. The site consists of 43 sq kilometres of protected land at the edge of the Sepilok-Kabili Forest Reserve, and facilities include a centre built to care for the rescued orang utans. Sepilok is run by the Sabah Wildlife Department and is considered to be a useful educational tool for creating awareness of the plight of orang utans, for both locals and visitors alike. A visit here will give you the opportunity to learn of the rehabilitation process and see these gentle apes up close and personal during the feeding times. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You will also visit the recently set up Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre (BSBCC) center to rehabilitate Bornean sun bears, the smallest, most arboreal and least studied bear. These bears are also mainly diurnal and do not hibernate but build nests in trees to sleep in. You will be able to see them up close here in their enclosure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not to miss in the Sepilok-Kabili Forest Reserve is the Rainforest Discovery Center (RDC). Set up originally as an environmental education center for students and teachers, it opened its doors to visitors in 2007 and today is one of the main attraction of any visits to Sepilok because of its excellent set up by Sabah Forestry Department. Discover the rainforest of Borneo from the treetops along a 347 metres-long steel, canopy walkway and explore the extensive network of rainforest discovery trails on its grounds.
