				<h1>Semporna Archipelago</h1>
				<p>
					Most people come to the Semporna Islands for the crown jewel Sipadan Island, famed by the French marine biologist Jacques Cousteau in 1989. He spent three  months diving around the island from his research vessel ‘Calypso’ and said ‘ I have seen other places like Sipadan 45 years ago, but now no more. Now we have found an untouched piece of art’. It became a haven for serious divers and regularly voted as one of the top dive destinations in the world.

					Despite all the spotlight on Sipadan, the Semporna Archipelago, located within the Coral Triangle region that is recognized as the global centre of marine biodiversity, has a lot to offer non-divers. The Tun Sakaran Marine Park, also known as Semporna Islands Park, is a marine park located in the same area, consisting of the islands of Bodgaya, Boheydulang, Sebangkat and Selakan, the sand cays of Maiga, Sibuan and Mantabuan, and the patch reefs of Church and Kapikan. On these islands, you will find refuge on beautiful white sand beaches, great snorkeling in little bays and lagoons, and one can even hike up the hill of Boheydulang for a bird’s eye view of the archipelago. The marine park is also the best area to learn of the marginalized plight of the Bajau Laut ‘sea gypsies’, who comprises of a fascinating community of people surviving entirely on marine resources.

					Divers or not, a visit to the Semporna Islands will leave you breathless.
