												Met by our driver at your hotel in KK at 6.30am for the 2 hour journey to Kinabalu Park (breakfast on your own). Upon arrival, our driver will assist with registration and fees before dropping you off at Timpohon Gate, the start of climb, with your mountain guide.  
												<br /><br />
												The climb on the 1st day is 6km with an elevation gain of about 1,300 meters. This takes 4 - 6 hours depending on fitness, and there are rest stops with toilets along the way. There are opportunities to refill your water bottles on the way up but since the water is not treated, we recommend water purification tablets or iodine for this. Alternatively, you can stock up on drinking water before commencing your climb. 
												<br /><br />
												Along the way, observe the fascinating montane forest with pitcher plants, rhododendrons and orchids. Stop enroute to eat your packed lunch. Upon arrival at the resthouse in Laban Rata, check into your accommodation and settle in. You will have access to filtered drinking water and will be able to re-fill your water bottle. Dinner is between 4.30 - 6.30pm and lights out at 8pm.

After sunrise, return to Laban Rata for a full breakfast before checking out and making your way to the base of the mountain. Most people take 4-5 hours to return to the base. Your driver will be waiting for you at the start of the trail to take you to the restaurant at the Kinabalu National Park headquarters for lunch before returning to Kota Kinabalu.
