						The Kinabalu Camping program takes you to a little used substation of Kinabalu National Park, with vast jungle, a temperate climate, and an abundance of biodiversity. Located at 1,080 meters above sea level, the primary rainforest is filled with orchids, giant trees and waterfalls. The campsite is along a beautiful mountain river, with western toilets and showers just a short walk from the basecamp.
					</p>
					<p>
						The ‘via ferrata’ portion is an addition to the summit climb (attempted after your summit to the peak). The Mt Kinabalu via ferrata is one of the highest via ferrata in the world at 3,776metres. You can choose between 2 via ferrata programs:

									Met by our driver at your hotel in KK at 6.30am for the 2 hour journey to Kinabalu Park (breakfast on your own). Upon arrival, our driver will assist with registration and fees before dropping you off at Timpohon Gate, the start of climb, with your mountain guide. 
									<br /><br />
									The climb on the 1st day is 6km with an elevation gain of about 1,300 meters. This takes 4-6 hours depending on fitness, and there are rest stops with toilets along the way. There are opportunities to refill your water bottles on the way up but since the water is not treated, we recommend water purification tablets or iodine for this. Alternatively, you can stock up on drinking water before commencing your climb. 
									<br /><br />
									Along the way, observe the fascinating montane forest with pitcher plants, rhododendrons and orchids. Stop en-route to eat your packed lunch. Upon arrival at Pendant Hut, check into your accommodation and settle in, and attend the mandatory via ferrata familiarization by your Mountain Torq trainer. You will have access to filtered drinking water and will be able to refill your water bottle. Dinner is served at 6pm and lights out at 8pm.

									Early morning wake up for coffee or tea at 2.30am. Continue your climb to the summit for sunrise. Make sure you have your headlamp with you during this portion of the climb to the summit. After sunrise, meet your via ferrata trainer at Sayat Sayat Hut for your via ferrata experience. Then, return to Pendant Hut for a full breakfast before checking out and making your way to the base of the mountain. Most people take 4-5 hours to return to the base. Your driver will be waiting for you at the start of the trail to take you back to Kota Kinabalu.
