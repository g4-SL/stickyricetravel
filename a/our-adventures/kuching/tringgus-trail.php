					The Tringgus trail takes you to beautiful and remote Bidayuh villages beyond Bau and close to the Indonesian border. Taking unmade roads (wherever possible) around the Bau area, we visit remote villages with real skulls in the head house, negotiate limestone hill tracks, visit the Fairy cave chamber and cool down with a swim in a local river. Theres' something about a landrover that brings out the best in people â€“ expect a warm welcome wherever you go!

								At 9.00am, pick up from your hotel at Kuching city and ride to Tringgus Trail, bringing you to a beautiful and remote Bidayuh village beyond Bau. Travel onwards on foot for about 30 minutes in primary jungle with local guides to the Indonesian border. See real skulls in the headhouse and how life is lived in the same manner as it has been for centuries. On the way, visit a village which played a major role in the history of Sarawak, a birds nest trader and a local produce market. Lunch is served as Bidayuh style. After lunch, visit the enormous Fairy Cave chamber where the guide will explain the geological processes involved in its creation and then to a second village, as remote as the first, whose inhibitants were famed for their ferocity. Our offroad segment takes us high into a nearby mountain range before we head back to Kuching at 5.30pm.
