						Our acclaimed caving expedition for virtually everyone. Completed by anyone ranging between the age of 5 and 75, our flagship product is safe, informative and very much the real thing! The cave is huge, the chambers are incredible and the calcite beautiful. Add to all that extensive biodiversity and you have an amazing adventure in store. This is not a show cave and we rarely see anyone else apart from the birds nest collectors.

									Pick up from hotel in Kuching city at 8.45am and drive for about 1.5 hours to a Bidayuh village in a pretty farming valley. Once the equipment and safety briefings are completed, there is a 10 minutes walk across some of the areaâ€™s prettiest farmland to the staircase to the cave entrance. Once in the cave, there will be a briefing on its history and pre-history as you look at the cave paintings that cover the walls. Then head deeper inside the cave. Ceilings in this cave can be as high as 100 metre and there are streams, waterfalls and enormous calcite structures to admire as well as a wide range of cave dwellers. The easy route visits two chambers before leaving through the main exit. The intermediate route goes much further into the cave including passing through to the bird nest chamber before we retrace our steps. We enter a second cave in a clear refreshing river. Swimming is possible but not essential. After a short climb, we return to the river for a further 50 metre and into a magical chamber which is the end of the route. After cleaning up, a meal is provided either in the Kampung (village) or at a restaurant on the way back to Kuching. Return to hotel at 7pm.
