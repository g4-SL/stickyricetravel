								Pick up from hotel at 4pm and drive from Kuching for about 30 minutes to the Santubong Boat Club. Board a boat and start your cruise around the rivers, creeks and mangroves of the Santubong Peninsular. 
								<br /><br />
								You first cruise to the mouth of the Santubong River, where Irrawaddy dolphins are regularly sighted. From there you cruise the mangrove-lined rivers and estuaries looking for wildlife, including proboscis monkeys. Groups of these strange looking monkeys are often seen amongst the mangroves at the waterâ€™s edge. 
								<br /><br />
								As the light fades, your boatman searches for fireflies and crocodiles. Crocodiles are sometimes seen on the muddy riverbanks. Bright crocodile eyes are often spotted when a torch light is shined over the water. Fireflies gather along certain areas of the river. Watch the fireflies light up the branches of the mangroves before returning to the boat club and then travelling back to Kuching.
								<br /><br />
								<i>Note: The tour does not operate during rough sea conditions or heavy rain. Wildlife sightings are not guaranteed. However, wildlife often seen on this cruise includes Irrawaddy dolphins, proboscis monkeys, crocodiles, silver-leaf monkeys, fireflies, long-tailed macaque monkeys, monitor lizards and a range of birds, including egrets, white-bellied sea eagles and kingfishers.</i>
