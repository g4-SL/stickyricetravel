					Venture to two of Sabah's hidden treasures, Orou Sapulot and Maliau Basin! At Sapulot, you will experience the Murut hospitability where people drink bottomless rice wine from huge ceramic jars and have endless chat about the Murut headhunting ancestors. Challenge yourself at scaling the 800 feet limestone pinnacle called Batu Punggul, explore mysterious caves and sleep on stretcher hammocks in a jungle camp perched high on a riverbank. Enjoy traditional Murut food and navigate rivers that run through pristine rainforest in traditional longboats, 'perahu'.
				</p>	
				<p>
					The second half of the trip will bring you to Maliau Basin, often referred to as "Sabah's Lost World". Situated in a remote Southern area of the state, Maliau Basin is almost completely encircled by insurmountable cliffs that have separated it from the rest of the world for centuries. Although some locals would have known of the area, no archaeological record has been found establishing any permanent residency ever in this zone. A Maliau Basin expedition is for the truly geeky at heart when it comes to nature, and you also have to be prepared to walk 5-8 hours daily with some extended, strenuous uphill sections throughout your time there.

				<div class="bgw pad">
					<p>
						Be aware that you will be in a reserve area and a sensitive environment. Consider your actions:		
						<ul class="l1">
							<li>
								Cut out plastic - remove and recycle plastic packaging before coming into the area
							</li>
							<li>
								Bring rechargeable batteries as disposable batteries leach toxic chemicals as they degrade in landfill, and recycling facilities are scarce in areas like the Malaysian Borneo
							</li>
							<li>
								Bring your own metal water bottle – you can fill up at the eating area instead of purchasing bottled water
							</li>
							<li>
								If you smoke, never throw your cigarette butts on the ground or in the forest – dispose of them in ashtrays or bins.
							</li>
							<li>
								During outdoor and nature activities, take your cues from the expert local guides. Follow their instructions when observing wildlife. Be aware that you may need to take extra care in these areas to respect the natural environment.
