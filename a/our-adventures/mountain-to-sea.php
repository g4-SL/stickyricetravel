						Experience both the mountains and the sea all in one trip! Camping is done at Sayap, a little substation of Kinabalu National Park. The campsite is along a beautiful mountain river and is surrounded with abundance of biodiversity. With such little light polution in the area, you will be able to enjoy a starry night sky all night long. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The second half of the trip brings you to Manana Borneo, which is located on a private bay about slightly over an hour north of Kota Kinabalu. Compared to the marine park of Kota Kinabalu, Manana Borneo is less travelled and thus gives a more quiet and comfortable stay. Manana Borneo is also the perfect place to take your Open Water Diver certification if you are thinking of exploring the underwater world. Big Fin Diver, located on the beach, is a certified PADI diving school offering PADI programs.

						<p>
							Be aware that you will be in a reserve area and a sensitive environment. Consider your actions:		
							<ul class="l1">
								<li>
									Cut out plastic - remove and recycle plastic packaging before coming into the area
								</li>
								<li>
									Bring rechargeable batteries as disposable batteries leach toxic chemicals as they degrade in landfill, and recycling facilities are scarce in areas like the Malaysian Borneo
								</li>
								<li>
									Bring your own metal water bottle – you can fill up at the eating area instead of purchasing bottled water
								</li>
								<li>
									If you smoke, never throw your cigarette butts on the ground or in the forest – dispose of them in ashtrays or bins.
								</li>
								<li>
									During outdoor and nature activities, take your cues from the expert local guides. Follow their instructions when observing wildlife. Be aware that you may need to take extra care in these areas to respect the natural environment.
