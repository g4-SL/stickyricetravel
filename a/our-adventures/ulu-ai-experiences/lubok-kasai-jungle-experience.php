					Meet the Iban people, enjoy the pleasures of upriver travel, stay at the Nanga Sumpa Lodge &amp; Lubok Kasai Jungle Camp on this extended program to fully experience the Borneo rainforest  and its people. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The Lubok Kasai Jungle Camp is located a further 30 - 45 minute boat ride upriver from Nanga Sumpa, deep in the heart of Borneo. It is situated on the banks of the Lalang River in an area where orangutans are commonly sighted. The camp is located in a stunning setting at the edge of the rainforest. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This program is for those who want to maximise their time experiencing the rainforest and culture of the indigenous people of the area. The Lubok Kasai Jungle Camp offers the opportunity to experience a totally natural and tranquil setting; away from the sights, sounds and activities of a vibrant longhouse. Staying here for 2 nights offer visitors more time to explore the rainforest, spot wildlife and enjoy the cool waters of the Lalang River.
