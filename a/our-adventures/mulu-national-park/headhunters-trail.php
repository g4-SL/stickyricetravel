					Discover the showcaves of Mulu National Park, climb the Pinnacles and trek the headhunters’ trail at the Mulu UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Headhunter’s Trail is a great way of entering or leaving Gunung Mulu National Park. The trek combines upriver travel, jungle trekking and an overnight stay at an Iban longhouse. The trail itself follows the route taken by Kayan headhunting parties who paddled up the Melinau River to Melinau Gorge. They then dragged their longboats through the forest for 3 km until they reached the banks of the Terikan River, where they launched headhunting raids against the people of the Limbang area. This trek offers an excellent introduction to the rivers and rainforest of Mulu, with the added attraction of the Pinnacle climb and longhouse stay.

								Arrive at Mulu airport in the morning and transfer to the park accommodation for check in. In the afternoon enjoy a scenic 3 km plankwalk through primary rainforest to the entrance of Deer Cave, the world’s largest cave passage. The entrance of the cave is 150 metre wide and 120 metre high - nowhere in this massive cave is the roof less than 90 metre high. The cave has a moon-like landscape and from one vantage point, you can see a perfect profile of President Lincoln. Next to Deer Cave is Langs Cave. The stalactites and stalagmites inside this cave are representative of the very best limestone formations in the park. After viewing the two caves, proceed to the Bat Observatory outside Deer Cave. A spectacular exodus of about 2 million of bats can be observed at sundown as they leave the cave in search of food. Then trek back to the park HQ by torchlight and return to your accommodation.

							<th><img src="c/day2.png" alt="Day 2 - Day Two" /></th>

								In the morning, proceed by longboat upriver to Wind Cave with its impressive ‘King’s Chamber’. Here, stalactites and stalagmites with delicate lace-like patterns are found. Walk along a plankwalk next to the limestone cliff and climb up approximately 250 concrete steps to reach the entrance of Clearwater Cave. Like most caves in Mulu, Clearwater Cave provides a habitat for unique species of plants such as the one-leafed plant which can only be found at Mulu. Photo-sensitive algae grows on certain rocks and produce needle-like formations that point towards the source of light. 
								<br /><br />
								Nearby Clearwater Cave, there is a wonderful swimming area shaded by giant rainforest trees. Enjoy a simple picnic or packed lunch. After lunch, proceed to Long Litut which is an hour boat ride away. Start trekking to Camp 5 for approximately 3 hours through a mixed dipterocarp and riparian forest. Overnight at Camp 5.
