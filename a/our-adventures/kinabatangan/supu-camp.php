						The Eco Camp falls under the MESCOT Initiatives that was designed to empower and build local capacity, and plan ecologically sustainable community based ecotourism activities in the villages of Batu Puteh, Menggaris and Perpaduan in the wildife hotspots of lower Kinabatangan area. 
					</p>
					<p>
						One of MESCOT’s main aim is to create an alternative source of income that will also benefit the conservation of the remaining rich natural forest resources and biodiversity of the area. First started in 1997 based on its core idea of involvement of local community through participatory planning, the MESCOT Initiatives has come a long way in establishing itself as one of the more succesful community-based tourism in Malaysia, first establishing a homestay program, followed by the Eco Camp and Supu Camp. All programs are run entirely by the communities of the 3 villages through a village cooperative.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Supu Camp is located on a very quiet area of the lower Kinabatangan area. Most people come here to escape the tourist hotspots of the Kinabatangan, and a visit here promises an added adventure aside from the river cruises – at Supu Camp, you sleep in stretcher hammocks in an open-air forest camp perched high on the riverbank. Similar to its sister property the Eco Camp, the facilities are basic but allows total jungle immersion - low voltage LED bulbs provide lights during the night and western-style showers and toilets are shared while meals are cooked by your guides in the simple kitchen. During the day, trek through secondary forests that is home to a variety of wildlife, explore undiscovered limestone caves, scale a limestone pinnacle in the jungle and be amazed at age-old burial sites containing carved wooden coffins. This program is suitable for the adventurous at heart as the extensive network of forest trails and caves keep you occupied aside from just cruising the river for wildlife. After the sun has gone down, embark on night treks to see nocturnal wildlife.

					<h2 class="grunge6">Responsible Traveler</h2>
					<div class="bgw pad">
						<p>
							The communities of Orang Sungai that inhabit the Kinabatangan Floodplain are conservative and Muslim. Please be sensitive to the local culture:
						</p>

						<p>
							Adhere to a modest dress code - for women, recommended shorts are around knee-length (or cover most thigh areas) and no low-cut or too tight-fitting tops. It is highly recommended to cover shoulders. Men should never go without a shirt regardless of how humid you think the local weather is - this is considered rude and a sure-fire way of not being accepted in rural areas.
						</p>

						<p>
							Public display of affection is frowned upon and should be avoided at all times.
						</p>

						<p>
							Do not bring any alcohol into the village with you and never entertain any invitation by locals or tourist to consume alcohol within the village.
						</p>

						<p>
							Never give money to children or anyone in the village unless it is part of gratuities or tips. Instead, consider supporting in sustainable ways by supporting programs and projects by the community or NGOs that work with them.
