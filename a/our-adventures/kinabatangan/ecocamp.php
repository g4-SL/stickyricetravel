					The Eco Camp falls under the MESCOT Initiatives that was designed to empower and build local capacity, and plan ecologically sustainable community based ecotourism activities in the villages of Batu Puteh, Menggaris and Perpaduan in the wildife hotspots of lower Kinabatangan area. 
				</p>
				<p>
					One of MESCOT’s main aim is to create an alternative source of income that will also benefit the conservation of the remaining rich natural forest resources and biodiversity of the area. First started in 1997 based on its core idea of involvement of local community through participatory planning, the MESCOT Initiatives has come a long way in establishing itself as one of the more succesful community-based tourism in Malaysia, first establishing a homestay program, followed by the Eco Camp and Supu Camp. All programs are run entirely by the communities of the 3 villages through a village cooperative.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Eco Camp sits on the banks of an Oxbow Lake – the pristine Tungo Lake, and is the only accommodation on the Kinabatangan that is located in a forest reserve. If you are a no-fuss traveler and comfortable being in nature, the Eco Camp is for you. Built with the environment in mind, the camp aims to have a zero-waste, zero-chemical, zero-energy spreadsheet and maximum water conservation. Your stay here also supports the lake restoration (salvinia removal) and orang utan habitat restoration (tree planting project) through the MESCOT Initiative. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The camp offers basic facilities yet lovely - electricity is available in the night and low voltage LED bulbs provide lights in the walkways and common areas. Each raised A-frame huts sleep 2 comfortably .There is a spacious platform outside for nature and wildlife observation. Western-style showers and toilets are communal, and meals are served buffet-style at the eating lounge by the lake. Wildlife aside, you will have the chance to visit a forest restoration project along with other programs run by the community in trying to preserve their sensitive environment. There is also an extensive 18km of forest trails to explore surrounding the area.

				<h2 class="grunge6">Responsible Traveler</h2>
				<div class="bgw pad">
					<p>
						The communities of Orang Sungai that inhabit the Kinabatangan Floodplain are conservative and Muslim. Please be sensitive to the local culture:
					</p>

					<p>
						Adhere to a modest dress code - for women, recommended shorts are around knee-length (or cover most thigh areas) and no low-cut or too tight-fitting tops. It is highly recommended to cover shoulders. Men should never go without a shirt regardless of how humid you think the local weather is - this is considered rude and a sure-fire way of not being accepted in rural areas.
					</p>

					<p>
						Public display of affection is frowned upon and should be avoided at all times.
					</p>

					<p>
						Do not bring any alcohol into the village with you and never entertain any invitation by locals or tourist to consume alcohol within the village.
					</p>

					<p>
						Never give money to children or anyone in the village unless it is part of gratuities or tips. Instead, consider supporting in sustainable ways by supporting programs and projects by the community or NGOs that work with them.
