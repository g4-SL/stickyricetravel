				<h2 class="grunge5">Responsible Traveler</h2>
				<div class="bgw pad">
					<p>
						Be aware that you will be in a reserve area and a sensitive environment. Consider your actions:		
						<ul class="l1">
							<li>
								Cut out plastic - remove and recycle plastic packaging before coming into the area
							</li>
							<li>
								Bring rechargeable batteries as disposable batteries leach toxic chemicals as they degrade in landfill, and recycling facilities are scarce in areas like the Malaysian Borneo
							</li>
							<li>
								Bring your own metal water bottle – you can fill up at the eating area instead of purchasing bottled water
							</li>
							<li>
								If you smoke, never throw your cigarette butts on the ground or in the forest – dispose of them in ashtrays or bins.
							</li>
							<li>
								During outdoor and nature activities, take your cues from the expert local guides. Follow their instructions when observing wildlife. Be aware that you may need to take extra care in these areas to respect the natural environment.
