				<h1>Mulu National Park</h1>
				<p>
					Gunung Mulu National Park is one of nature’s most astounding features in Sarawak’s expanding network of national parks. It is also the largest national park, covering 544 sq km of primary rainforest; criss-crossed by fast flowing rivers and clear jungle streams. Mulu is dominated by three mountains – Gunung Mulu (2,376 m), Gunung Api (1,750 m) and Gunung Benarat (1,858 m), yet many of Mulu’s greatest attractions lie deep below the surface. Hidden underneath the forested slopes of these mountains is one of the largest limestone cave system in the world. This system, a breath-taking natural wonder, contains a number of record breaking caves.

				<p>
					There are 4 showcaves in Mulu - selected for their uniqueness or sheer beauty. They can all be visited as day trips from the park HQ and are accessible by plankwalks and well-lit concrete paths. Strategically positioned spotlights highlight the unique features of the individual caves. A plankwalk leads through the forest to Deer Cave and Lang’s Cave whilst Clearwater Cave and Wind Cave are reached by taking a longboat up the Melinau River.

					For the adventurous, one can also challenge themselves to climb the series of pinnacles at Mulu National Park or trek the headhunters' trail, following the route that was taken by the Kayan headhunters. If you are looking for a more physical yet breathtaking travelling experience, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a place that would do both for you.
