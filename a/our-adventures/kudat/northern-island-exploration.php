				Join us for 5 days of exploring untouched culture and pristine islands off the northern coasts of Sabah. We will be travelling by sea, camping on islands, and exploring a path less travelled. Our days will be filled with activities such as hiking, snorkelling, exploring caves, and doing some serious relaxing! Local communities help us out with cooking and logistics and we support these people directly. We will spend time in villages and get to know their culture and lifestyle. We will have bonfires on the beach, and absorb the serenity of island life.
				</p>
				<p>
				We do a big loop of the islands, starting and finishing at a jetty in Kudat. Every island has its own personality and a different set of activities.

					This trip is for people who like true adventure and beautiful places. It is for free-spirited people who want to get away and explore. The sea is not always calm. Sometimes its sunny, sometimes rainy; it is the tropics and it is only 6 degrees from the equator. No matter what the weather, we make the most of our trips, still getting the most out of the journey.
