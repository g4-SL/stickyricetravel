						If you are looking for an idyllic beach getaway to relax with family and friends for a few days without sacrificing comfort and luxury, and wanting to get away from the big resorts, Hibiscus Villa is the place for you. A holiday villa nestled amongst a former coconut plantation on the north coast of Sabah, near the Tip of Borneo, is surely to impress anyone looking for a beach holiday with style. 
					</p>				
					<p>
						You can explore the numerous beaches and bays, walk to the Tip of Borneo, try your skills at fishing, go snorkeling, or even try a trek through the forest areas nearby. It is possible to pre-arrange a range of activities during your stay at the villa including mangrove river cruise, scuba diving, fishing or boat trips, jungle trekking including survival course, visit the Rungus museum where the traditions and culture of the local Rungus people can be explained, or a day out with a local in their farms – rice planting, rubber tapping, foreshore seafood foraging, rice de-husking, collecting coconuts, fishing with hand-nets. If all that sounds too stressful for you, massage and spa treatments are also available upon requests. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Offering modern comfort and facilities, it is the perfect place for couples, honeymooners and families looking to relax and explore the Kudat area.
