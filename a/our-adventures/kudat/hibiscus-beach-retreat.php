						A sister lodge to the original Hibiscus Villa, Hibiscus Beach Retreat is a self-contained one-bedroom chalet right on the beach, perfect for couples and small families looking for privacy at an absolutely stunning and exclusive location. 
					</p>				
					<p>
						Perch on a small cliff top with views of the South China Sea, wake up to an amazing view of the ocean. After breakfast, walk down steps to the beach – go for a swim, snorkel or stroll, or simply siesta in the hammock or sunbathe on the deck of the chalet.  
					</p>
					<p>
						You can explore the numerous beaches and bays, walk to the Tip of Borneo, try your skills at fishing, go snorkeling, or even try a trek through the forest areas nearby. It is possible to pre-arrange a range of activities during your stay at the villa including mangrove river cruise, scuba diving, fishing or boat trips, jungle trekking including survival course, visit the Rungus museum where the traditions and culture of the local Rungus people can be explained, or a day out with a local in their farms – rice planting, rubber tapping, foreshore seafood foraging, rice de-husking, collecting coconuts, fishing with hand-nets. However, bear in mind that these activities are seasonal and dependent on the locals being able to take you with them. If all that sounds too stressful for you, massage and spa treatments are also available upon requests.
