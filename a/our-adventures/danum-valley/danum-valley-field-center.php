				<h1>Danum Valley Field Center (DVFC)</h1>
				<p>
					The Danum Valley Field Center was established in 1986 as a center for conducting researches and supporting scientists in rainforest studies. Today, the center is one of the leading field centers of its kind in Southeast Asia, fully equipped with laboratory, conference room, scientist and research assistants living quarters, dorms, camping grounds, eating lounge, and internet facility.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the name implies, it is first and foremost a research center designed for scientists. It is not a facility designed in mind to cater to tourist therefore there is minimal tourism hospitality and service. Over the years, the privilege of staying there has been extended to keen naturalists or independent travellers who want to be in an area that has a high concentration of wildlife and old forests. 
				</p>	
				<p>	
					When you book one of our DVFC programs, you will be accompanied by our nature guides throughout the duration of your stay, and your walks will be punctuated with nature interpretations and explanations of the forests. Our nature guides are also at the top of their games when it comes to the area – they know it like the back of their hands, have eyes like hawks when it comes to spotting wildlife, and enjoy being around people.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is plenty to keep you occupied during your days there – you will wake up early to go to a tree hide to observe wildlife at their most active, longer hikes are optional for those who are more adventurous, you can swim in the river to excape midday heat, go on night walks to spot nocturnal creatures, or arrange a morning sunrise trip to watch the sun rises atop the forest canopies. Danum Valley Field Center is recommended for keen naturalists and fuss-free, adventurous travelers who can be contented with basic yet clean and comfortable facilities.
