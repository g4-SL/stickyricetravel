						For the more adventurous, our Sg Purut Camping program takes you a step deeper into the interior of Danum Valley by combining time at the center and one of the satellite camps in the valley – Sg Purut camp. Aside from the standard nature and wildlife observation surrounding the center, you will also get to experience sleeping deep in the Borneo rainforest on this program. The trekking to Sg Purut from the center on Day 2 &amp; 3 can be challenging but the reward is high as you get to walk through some pristine patches of forest on your way to the camp and swim in a beautiful waterfall upon arrival. This is an expedition style adventure and you will be sleeping in basic stretcher hammocks at the Sg Purut camp, and your choice of accommodation at the center on 1st and last night.
