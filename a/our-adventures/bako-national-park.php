				<h1>Bako National Park</h1>
				<p>
					Bako is one of the best national parks in Malaysia to see wildlife in a natural setting and experience the rainforest via a network of trekking trails. Gazetted in 1957, Bako is Sarawak’s oldest national park, covering an area of 2,727 hectares at the tip of the Muara Tebas peninsula. It is one of the smallest national parks in Sarawak, yet one of the most interesting, as it contains almost every type of vegetation found in Borneo. Forest types range from mangrove to kerangas (heath forest), tropical swamp vegetation, cliff vegetation and beach vegetation. It is also one of the best places in Sarawak to see wildlife in a natural setting - the various types of animals that are commonly spotted at Bako include the proboscis monkeys, silver leaf monkeys, long-tailed macaques, wild boars, monitor lizards and numerous species of birds. The well-maintained network of nature trails - from easy forest strolls to full-day jungle treks – allows visitors to get the most out of this unique environment.
