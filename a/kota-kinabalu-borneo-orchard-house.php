					Get outside the city and into the kitchen with our specialty outdoor cooking classes, located at ‘Momma’s House’, about 15 minutes outside of Kota Kinabalu. This program will take you to a local market with your program host before proceeding to a local home for the cooking lesson.

								Picked up from your hotel in Kota Kinabalu at 8.30am and straight to the market with your host. You will start your excursion with learning how the locals buy their food in a local market or ‘tamu’. You will see produce – meat, seafood, fruit and vegetable, all grown locally for local consumption. 
								<br /><br />
								We then proceed to Momma’s House in one of the villages in the outskirt of the city. Your host family will treat you like family and share their family recipes to cook like a Sabahan. Sit down with the family and eat lunch at the house after the cooking lesson. Your driver will transfer you back to your hotel in Kota Kinabalu around 3pm.
