				<h1>Our Team</h1>
				<div class="short_line"></div>
				<h4>
					What started as a home-based work with only 2 employees, Sticky Rice Travel has now grown bigger with an office located in the heart of the city in Sabah and an amazing set of team working under it. Our travel consultants work around the clock to accommodate all of our clients' needs and are always there from the start of the planning to the last day of the trip. Our travel guides are highly experienced and opinionated on all things related to Borneo and will go out their way to make sure our clients have a memorable stay here at Borneo. We believe that Sticky Rice Travel wouldn't be where it is at now without our incredible team.

						<h1>Jessica Yew</h1>
						<h4>Director / Founder</h4>
						<p>
							Corporate world drop out, Jessica left the constraints of the corporate desk to head back to her hometown in search of something more. But the journey home was longer than expected, as she made a detour backpacking through Europe, Asia and then residing in Vietnam for a few years as a rock-climbing assistant, before finally making the move home to Kota Kinabalu. Once home she was quick to plunge into the deep blue becoming a dive master in just 8 months. She has an inescapable itch for the outdoors, but has found a balance by spending half her time at the Sticky Rice Office and the other out guiding National Geographic Adventure’s Indochina destinations. What excites her the most when travelling is the people and culture, the common thread among communities’ worlds away.

						<h1>Charles Ryan</h1>
						<h4>Director / Founder</h4>
						<p>
							Sometimes, things just fall into place by accident. Signed up for a global volunteer program in Indonesia, the program was re-routed for Sabah, Borneo where Charlie would unknowingly reside for the next 8 years. On the Kinabatangan he assisted in setting up community initiative programs for the community at Abai Village, in 2008 and then later working with the Penan Community in Sarawak. It was also during his time on the Kinabatangan that he and Atteh, our Sticky Rice Travel Nature Guide, first met. Guiding for National Geographic Adventure groups in Borneo, Charlie also trains our nature guides providing them with first hand knowledge and experience. Besides guiding, he is also an avid photographer, which goes hand in hand with his passion for wildlife, culture and travel.
