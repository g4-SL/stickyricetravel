						Mt Kinabalu has re-open for bookings in September following almost 2 months of closure after the earthquake in June. Do take note that the new route ends at Laban Rata (3,272m above sea level), 2.8km from the summit, and that climbers are limited to 100 a day. Laban Rata is the last stop for climbers heading to the summit and is where the accommodations are located. Previously the remaining distance is covered on Day 2, making your way to the summit for sunrise. However, the path to the summit is still under assessment by the Technical Committee set up to oversee the restoration efforts at Kinabalu Park, and climbers will now make their direct descent on Day 2.
						<br /><br />
						On June 5, 2015 a 6.0 magnitude earth quake  Sabah claiming the lives of 14 climbers and 4 mountain guide. The epicentre of the quake was 54 km from the world UNESCO site of Mount Kinabalu, standing at 4,095 meters. Strong tremors were felt in Kota Kinabalu city and most of the northwestern area of the state when the earth quake struck at 7.15AM local time. More than a hundred climbers were stranded on the summit following the strong tremors, triggering landslides and streams of falling rocks and boulders rendering the summit route impenetrable.
