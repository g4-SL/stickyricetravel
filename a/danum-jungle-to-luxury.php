					If you like being active and love a challenge, and wouldn’t mind some pampering towards the end of your jungle adventure, why not consider our Wild Jungle to Luxury program? This program is suitable for those who are active and adventurous, and want a rainforest immersion. This is an expedition style adventure that involves sleeping in basic satellite camp and DVFC, with a nice finish at the more upscale Borneo Rainforest Lodge. You have the chance to trek deep in the valley where few people go, and learn of the biodiversity of flora and fauna of the area from your guide. Some parts of the hiking can be tough but the reward is high as you get to experience pristine rainforest, beautiful waterfall and wildlife. At Borneo Rainforest Lodge, you will be pampered with delicious food, comfortable accommodation and excellent guides.
