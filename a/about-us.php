						"Our guide adapted to all our requests, including long night drives and early birdwatching, which allowed us to see around 20 rare species of birds, small mammals and reptiles. The proficiency of our guide was really mindblowing. On top of this, the accommodation and food were also very good, which is impressive in such a remote area. Thumbs up for Sticky Rice!"
