					Corporate world drop out, Jessica left the constraints of the corporate desk to head back to her hometown in search of something more.

				<p>
					“The more you know, the more you don’t know”, is the irony that Yanti has come to realize over her travels. It’s what fuels her to explore, learn and discover more near and far. She completed her circuit of Indo-China in 2015, and is currently in pursuit of trying her hand on a variety of new hobbies while planning her next travel destination. She enjoys the serenity of diving, the satisfaction of finishing a hike and is extremely fond of Vietnamese coffee.
