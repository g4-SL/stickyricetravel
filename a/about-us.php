					We offer personalized travel planning to areas in Borneo that are home to sensitive ecosystems and 
					unique indigenous culture, and adhere to our responsible travel policy in doing our part in safeguarding 
					the environment and communities we work with. Sticky Rice Travel avoids mass tourism and is set up with 
					the aim of creating meaningful adventures - knowing that your travel highly considers travel impacts, 
					gives back wherever possible, and maximizing interaction with locals and local culture. We aim to pave 
					the way for responsible travel in Borneo.

				<h1>Why Travel With Us</h1>
				<h3>Focused market - we say no to mass tourism</h3>
				<p>
				We differentiate ourselves from other local travel agencies by catering to smaller and very focused markets
				which includes private departures for couples, honeymoon, family getaways, small group requests, university 
				research with specific Borneo interests, school groups and expeditions, private deluxe & VIP requests, and 
				niche markets such as wildlife-focus, birding etc. 
				</p>
				
				<h3>Destination knowledge - local expertise</h3>
				<p>
				Sticky Rice Travel is here to guide you, whether you know exactly where you want to go or need some travel inspiration. 
				With years of tourism experience under our belt, we have incredible ability and super powers when it comes to crafting 
				journeys that will surpass your expectations. We are passionate about what we do and how we do it, and continuously 
				explore new areas and hidden trails to ensure that we are ahead of our game. We make travel suggestions based on our 
				experiences; we don't just suggest places we have read about. We know the best hotels and their best rooms, we connect 
				you to experts in their fields, give you the best guides, and eager to share our knowledge with you.				
				</p>
				
				<h3>Personalized service - we create trips that are made for you</h3>
				<p>
				All of our trips including FITs have custom-made itineraries based on clients' specific interests and travel-style, 
				and all clients are assigned a travel consultant who will correspond with client on building the itinerary from beginning 
				to end. All our consultants have traveled extensively in their specific areas of assignment, and have the ability to craft 
				programs, suggest advice and recommendations based on budget etc. Our traveler number is also low, allowing for personalized 
				attention to detail and fast response.
				</p>		
				
				<h3>Insider access - exclusive programs only offered by us</h3>
				<p>
					We also pride ourselves in being able to craft unique itineraries to meet different travel-styles - we do not only promote 
					the standard highlights but have the in-depth knowledge and connections for program specialization so your program stands 
					out from other operators. Our network goes beyond the travel industry and extends to areas such as conservation and community 
					(on some of our deluxe trips, our clients visits leading NGOs such as HUTAN (Kinabatangan Orang Utan Conservation Program) to 
					learn of orang utan study, and take walks with leading experts such as Anthony Lamb, a Borneo-resident botanist with 
					specialization in flora of Borneo. Our school/university group expeditions spend time with remote local community that 
					maximizes their exposure towards local culture throughout the volunteering stage of their expedition.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Responsible travel - we care about the community, culture and environment</h3>
				<p>
					Our high commitment to responsible travel - our business model is different in the sense that we aim for steady and sustainable 
					growth while keeping very high standards, and always considering the impacts that tourism has on the areas that we send our 
					clients to. We choose our partners carefully, and often consider ethics and integrity before embarking on business partnerships. 
					Wherever possible, we choose to support and promote local businesses or community initiatives that aims to improve livelihood 
					and empowerment of community members.
				</p>
				
				<h3>We believe in giving back</h3>
				<p>
					We are currently working on setting up a foundation that will be partly funded by Sticky Rice Travel's contribution, with the aim 
					of focusing on local issues such as alternative livelihoods and education for remote communities, and possibly supporting creative 
					movement in urban communities in Sabah.
