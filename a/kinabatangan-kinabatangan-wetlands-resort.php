					Kinabatangan Wetlands Resort is a new gem located in Abai, a quieter area of the Lower Kinabatangan Floodplain, about 40km or about an hour’s boat ride from Sandakan harbor. If you are looking at something exclusive and away from the main tourist hotspots of Sukau &amp; Bilit, Kinabatangan Wetlands Resort is the place to be. The resort is surrounded by secondary forest reserves. It is located within beautiful nipah and mangrove vegetation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Apart from the river cruises, you can spend time relaxing and observing nature from your room. Myriad of birds and monkeys such as Silver Leaf Langur, Maroon Langur, Hose Langur, and Wild Orang Utan are regularly spotted within the area. Jungle trails via a raised boardwalk are made available for night walks and morning walks.
